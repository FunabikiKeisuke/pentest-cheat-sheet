# Ignition

## Enumeration

Starting off with an nmpa scan, we select the `-sC` and `-sV` switches to trigger default script scanning and version detection.

Upon attempting to access the webpage through a browser window, we are presented with the following error.

`cURL` will allow us to manipulate HTTP requests make to a server and receive the responses directly in the terminal, without the latter being interpreted by our browser as generic error messages such as in the example above.

As observed from the screenshot above, our request contains a `Host` field which is home to the target's IP address instead of the hostname. The `302 Found` response, together with the `Location` header, indicates that the resource we requested (`/`) has been (temporarily) moved to `http://ignition.htb/`. 

To solve the issue we are currently facing here, we will modify our local DNS file named `hosts` located in the `/etc` directory.

```bash
$ echo "{target_IP} ignition.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
$ cat /etc/hosts
{target_IP} ignition.htb
```

Reading the `/etc/hosts` file of your Linux system should return an entry for `ignition.htb` with the associated target IP address.

Once this configuration is complete, we can proceed to reload the target's webpage and verify if it loads successfully.

## Foothold

After exploring the landing page for a short period of time, we can deduce that nothing helpful can be leveraged here. The only option of exploring the website further is using gobuster.

From the output of our gobuster script, we find our target. The `/admin` page returns a 200 response code, signalling its' availability. We can navigate to it by appending it to the end of the URL: `http://ignition.htb/admin`.

According to the documentation, we should not attempt to brute force this login form because it has antibruteforce measures implemented, we will need to guess the password. Since the password must be seven or more characters long & to include both letters ad numbers, we can attempt to use the most common passwords of the year 2021 as well as a common username, such as `admin`. From the [list](https://cybernews.com/best-password-managers/most-common-passwords/) , only the following password fulfils the requirements.

```
admin admin123
admin root123
admin password1
admin administrator1
admin changeme1
admin password123
admin qwerty123
admin administrator123
admin changeme123
```

After manually attempting a number of these credentials, we land on a successful login. The correct combinationis : `admin:qwerty123`.

Congratulations!
