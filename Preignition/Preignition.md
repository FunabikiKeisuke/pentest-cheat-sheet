From the scan result, a single entry is shown and catches our attention. It is an http service running on port 80, signaling that this target might be hosting some explorable web content. To look at the contents ourselves, we can open a web browser of our choice and navigate to the target's IP address in the URL bar at the top of the window.

## Foothold

open `admin.php` in your web browser. We can try our luck with some default credentials since this is a fresh nginx installation.

```bash
Username: admin
Password: admin
```
